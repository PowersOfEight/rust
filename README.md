# A repository of my journey into the Rust Programming language



### I have EMERGED from the Bachelor's program

* Time to pick up where I left off
* Diving back into rust!!!

### Collection Exercises

* I created a simple roll-your-own test framework for the exercises
* Created the stat functions for mode and median
* Created the Pig Latin converter for Strings

### We're making progress

* Currently working on 18.2
  * _Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types_
  * Getting used to the whole 
  ```rust
  pub trait Trait {
    pub fn foo(&self);
  };

  pub impl Trait for Struct {
    pub fn foo(&self) {
      // Do things in here 
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Branch `organization`

  * Taking a little detour.  The goal of this branch is to create a command line program that has a library for its model.
